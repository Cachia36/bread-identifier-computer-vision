# Bread Identifier — Computer Vision with Deep Learning

This project is a computer vision application that classifies different types of bread using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It also includes a demonstration of geometric image transformations to illustrate classic image processing tasks.

📌 **Purpose**: Developed as part of the SWD6.3B coursework and added to my portfolio to demonstrate deep learning, OpenCV techniques, and image classification workflows.

## 🍞 Bread Identifier (Main Task)

- Trains a CNN to recognize different types of bread from images.
- Uses a preprocessed dataset and a Keras-based model.
- Final model (`bread_model.h5`) is tested and evaluated using custom input.
- Includes a demo video showing real-time inference (`Bread Identifier Testing.mp4`).

## 🧪 Task 2: Image Transformations

- `geometric_transformations.ipynb` demonstrates:
  - Rotation
  - Translation
  - Scaling
  - Perspective warping
- Uses OpenCV and Matplotlib.
